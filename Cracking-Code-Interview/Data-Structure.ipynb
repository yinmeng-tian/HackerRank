# A kidnapper wrote a ransom note but is worried it will be traced back to him. 
# He found a magazine and wants to know if he can cut out whole words from it and use them to create 
# an untraceable replica of his ransom note. The words in his note are case-sensitive 
# and he must use whole words available in the magazine, 
# meaning he cannot use substrings or concatenation to create the words he needs.
