# Task:  
# Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the respective mean, median, and mode on separate lines. 
# If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.
#The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array. 
#The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the array's elements.
